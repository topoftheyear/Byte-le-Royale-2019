# Competition Rules

There are two sections of rules for this event: Competition Rules and Event Rules.
ALL rules are to be followed, and if something comes up that is not covered by the rules, the 
ACM retains the right to review and rule on a case-by-case basis.

## Event Rules

1. Respect your fellow competitors and do not disrupt or otherwise interfere with them.
2. Keep your area clean.
3. No forming alliances with other teams (i.e. the teams involved all write their AI to assist each other)
4. Maintain appropriate behavior throughout the event and on any forms of communication used therein.
5. Any attempts to disrupt, interfere, or otherwise adversely affect any aspect of the event will result in a disqualification, including, but not limited to:
  * Forums
  * Scrimmage Server
  * Event staff
  * Other competitors

## Competition Rules

* ONLY the following imports are allowed:
  * math

* Do not attempt to access the game's source code.
* Avoid processes and procedures that will take an abnormally long time per turn. If your AI takes more than 0.05 seconds to take a turn, it not do anything that turn.
