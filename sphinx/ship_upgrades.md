# Ship Upgrades

## List of Upgrades
There are 7 different upgrades a ship can have:
* Hull Strength - How much damage you can take
* Engine Speed - How fast your ship moves in one action
* Weapon Damage - How powerful the weapon is
* Weapon Range - How far away your ship can attack enemies
* Cargo Space - How much space your ship has to store items
* Mining Yield - How fast your ship can mine
* Sensor Range - How far your ship's sensors can detect ships

## How To Upgrade
To purchase upgrades, go to the center station and use the `buy_module` function.
For upgrade levels 1 and 2, these are purchasable at the `Station Authority` station.
For upgrade levels 3, these are purchasable at the `***** ****** [!/@]` stations.
- Be warned, these are the illegal modules. They are lost on death.
